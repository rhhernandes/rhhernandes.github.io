<h2>About</h2>

<p>I am an artificial intelligence (AI) ethics researcher and data journalist specializing in the intersections between AI, journalism, and society. My work combines in-depth reporting and quantitative analysis to explore the ethical implications and societal impacts of AI technologies.</p>

<p>I hold a master’s degree in Ethics of AI, Data, and Algorithms from the University of Cambridge, graduating with distinction and receiving the Huw Price Prize for best overall performance in my cohort. My <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=arCHs-gAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">research</a> addresses how AI reshapes journalism, information environments, and epistemic security. </p>

<p>My journalism career includes roles as a data journalist at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/raphael-hernandes" target="_blank">The Guardian</a> (UK) and as an editor-at-large at <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/autores/raphael-hernandes.shtml" target="_blank">Folha de S.Paulo</a> (Brazil), where I led innovative data- and AI-driven newsroom projects and covered key topics at the intersection of technology and society.</p>

<p>As a Research Assistant at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (LCFI) at Cambridge, I analyzed media coverage of AI and examined the use of generative AI in political communication, also contributing to a <a href="https://www.desirableai.com/journalism-toolkit" target="_blank">toolkit</a> designed to help journalists responsibly navigate and implement AI technologies.</p>

<p>I regularly speak at technology and journalism conferences, engaging diverse audiences to foster critical understanding of AI’s role in society. I am committed to empowering the public through technology, data, and informed discourse on AI ethics and responsible innovation.</p>
