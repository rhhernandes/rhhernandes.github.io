<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am an AI ethics researcher and data journalist, I specialize in technology and artificial intelligence, both covering these topics and leveraging data and coding as part of my reporting. I hold a master's degree in Ethics of AI, Data, and Algorithms, having graduated with distinction from the University of Cambridge and received the Huw Price Prize for best overall performance in my cohort.</p>
<p>In my journalism career, I have worked as a data journalist at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/raphael-hernandes" target="_blank">The Guardian</a> (UK) and as an editor-at-large at <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/autores/raphael-hernandes.shtml" target="_blank">Folha de S.Paulo</a> (Brazil). In addition to reporting on technology and society, I led and implemented data- and AI-centric projects in the newsroom.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=arCHs-gAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">research</a> focuses on the intersections of AI and journalism, as well as on its impacts on the information environment and epistemic security. I leverage my experience in news media and employ quantitative methods to address the ethical challenges and opportunities posed by artificial intelligence in society. I have also worked as a Research Assistant at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (LCFI) at the University of Cambridge, where I focused on media coverage of AI and the use of generative AI in political communications. During that time, I helped develop a <a href="https://www.desirableai.com/journalism-toolkit" target="_blank">toolkit</a> featuring resources for journalists to responsibly cover and apply artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>As a speaker and communicator, I regularly engage with diverse audiences at technology and journalism conferences and have contributed to various media formats. My passion lies in using technology and data to inform, empower, and engage the public while fostering the critical use of AI.</p>
